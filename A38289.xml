            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THE former</hi> Journal <hi>of the honourable House of</hi> Commons, <hi>lately published, found so good a Reception amongst persons of Quality, that it hath given encouragement to the second to appear in Print. The purchace of so many written Coppies as have been dispers'd at so great rates (notwithstanding the many imperfections they are fraught withal) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates sufficiently, the vallue curious people sets up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; how much more acceptable therefore must they needs be, when purged from their Errors, and brought down to such a reasonable price, as to afford Gentlemen the benefit of them in their Libraries, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great Tax upon their Purses. The other Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn gave the first light of the Discovery of the</hi> Popish PLOT; <hi>which is made more manifest in this same:
<pb facs="tcp:46760:3"/> For here the Curtain is drawn open, the Scenes plainly appear, the Actors are brought upon the publick Stage, the fair Masque of Religion is pluckt off from the Fowl Face of Treason, which appears in its own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal hue, so ugly, as to make all conscientious Men, of what profession soever to start at the horrid sight of it. Nay so far did they go on in the pursuite after these Sons of Darkness, as to detect the very Soul of this Contrivance, and wanted but little of doing them that Justice as would have put an End to this Infamous Tragedy; which is now left till another Season to be compleated upon those Wretched Conspirators. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, here are many other extraordinary matters contained in these few sheets; to ennumerate them, were to transcribe the Journal, which being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Account of a whole Session, must be of great weight to considering men. The litteral mistakes of the Press, is not (as we hope,) a Sin above the mercy of the Candid Reader. God long preserve his Sacred Majesty, and make his two Houses of Parliament Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful in all their good Counsels and Ʋndertakings,</hi>

                  <p>That this House doth declare, that they are fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied by the Prooffs they▪ have heard, that there now is, and for divers years last past, hath been a Horrid

                  <p>Sir <hi>Henry Capel</hi> Reports from the Committee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to inspect the Journal of the Lords, and see what Resolutions they had taken, touching Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they had Inspected the Journal of the Lords House, and had agreed upon a Report, which he read in his place, and afterwards delivered in the same at the Clerks Table.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Resolved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>That the reading and consideration of the said Report, be adjourned, till Thursday next ten of the Clock.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Francis Winnington</hi> Reports, from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee appointed to inquire into the manner of suing forth the Pardon for <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Danby:</hi> That the Committee had attended the Lord Chancellor and made a search in all Offices concerned, in passing the Kings Letters Patents, and had agreed upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, which he read in his place, and afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the same in at the Clerks Table, where the same was again Read, and is as followeth.</p>
                  <p>The Committee in pursuance of the Order of the House, went to the several Offices, where the Kings Letters Patents always have and ought to pass.</p>
                  <p>First we went to Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventrys</hi> Office, and could find no entry of any such Pardon there, and some of the Committee spoke with Mr. Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry himself, who declared that he knew nothing of the passing the Pardon.</p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:46760:30"/>
                  <p>Wee likewise went to my Lord <hi>Sunderlands</hi> Office, and Mr. <hi>Bridgman</hi> his Secretary assured us, that there was no entry in that Office of any such Pardon.</p>
                  <p>But the Committee not being satisfyed with this, they resolved to attend my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> himself, this <hi>Munday</hi> morning: But my Lord was pleased to send to the Chair man, the Last Night, to inform the Committee that he knew nothing of the Pardon. From thence the Committee went to the Office of Signet and Privy Seal, and had an account there, that there was no Entry or Memorial of any such Pardon. From thence the Committee went to the Lord Privy Seal and his Lordship told us, that he never heard any Word of the Pardon until the day the King was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to mention it in the House of Lords. And further said, That if any such Pardon had come to him, he would have very well Considered, before he would have passed it:</p>
                  <p>After this the Committee attended my Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor. And he was Pleased to acquaint the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, that as to the Pardon, he neither advised, drew, nor altered one word of it, and that the Truth of the Fact was thus.</p>
                  <p>That my Lord Treasurer delivered it to him and being asked by the Committee whether the Pardon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Impeachments, his Lordships Answered, That it did, and had these general Words, of all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Crimes whatsoever, together with the Words <hi>omnia &amp; omnimoda Indictamenta Impetitiones,</hi> &amp; those other Words <hi>licet indictatus vel non indictatus vel non impetitus,</hi> &amp;c. and this was to extend to the seven and twentieth of <hi>February</hi> last, and did bear date the first of <hi>March</hi> instant.</p>
                  <p>My Lord Chancellor further declared, that my Lord Tresurer desired to have the Pardon pass with all the Privacy in the World, and the reason he gave
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46760:31"/> was, because he did not intend to make use of it, but stand upon his Innocency, except False Witnesses should be produced against him, and then he would make use of it, at the last extremity.</p>
                  <p>After this, my Lord Chancellor said, That he writ a Letter to my Lord Treasurer, wherein he took Notice to his Lordship, that in the first place the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the King was to be Considered, and if his Lordship would take his Advice, he thought it was best to let the Pardon pass the Regular Course, that it might be publickly known, that so it might Answer the End his Lordship intended, which was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Resuming the Impeachment against his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
                  <p>The next day after this Letter was sent, my Lord Chancellor Declared to the Committee, That he met my Lord Treasurer at the Committee of Foreign Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, where he gave my Lord Treasurer the same Advice as he gave in the Letter, which was to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade his Lordship. Thereupon my Lord Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer said, That he had acquainted the King with the Contents of the Letter, and that his Majesty did De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That He was resolved to have it done, which was to Pass the Pardon with all privacy. Suddenly after this, the King Commanded the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor to bring the Seal to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> which he did to his Lodgings, and being there he laid it upon the Table, thereupon his Majesty Commanded the Seal to be taken out of the Bagg, which his Lordship was Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to Submit unto, it not being in his Power to hinder it; and the King Writ his Name upon the top of the Parchment; and then directed to have it Sealed, whereupon the person that usually carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Purse, affixed the Seal to it.</p>
                  <p>My Lord Chancellor was pleased to say, That at the very time of affixing the Seal to the Parchment,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46760:31"/> he did not look upon himself to have the custody of the Seal. My Lord Chancellor concluded with this to the Committee, that he took upon himself to know, there was no memorial in any Office whatsoever of this Pardon, from the Secretaries Office, untill it came to his Lordship, but that it was a stampt Pardon by Creation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Resolved, nemine contradicente.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That a Message be sent to the Lords to demand Justice in the Names of the Commons of <hi>England</hi> against <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> and that he may be immediately sequestred from Parliament, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to safe Custody.</p>

               <p>That the Lords chose to deliver back this Bill by Conference rather than Message, to preserve a good understanding, and to prevent Debate or Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy between them.</p>

               <p>Therefore to a King so merciful and compassionate: the first Interruption of his Clemency they did desire should not proceed from the two Houses, pressing the King to an Act of the greatest Severity.</p>

               <p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46760:69"/> the same in at the Clerks Table: where the same were twice read, and upon the Question severally agreed to, and are as followeth, (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>THe addition to the Title, does shew that the Amendments made by your Lordships to the Bill, do wholly alter the nature of it, and from a Bill of Attainder, have converted it into a Bill of Banishment; which the Commons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not consent to, for these Reasons:</p>
                  </q>
                  <p n="1">1. That Banishment is not the legal Judgment in Cases of High-Treason; and the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impeached by the Commons of High-Treason, and fled from Justice, hath thereby confessed the Charge; and therefore ought to have the Judgment of High-Treason for his punishment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Banishment being not the punishment the Law inflicts upon those Crimes, the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> might make use of this remission of his Sentence, as an Argument that either the Commons were distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of their Proofs against him, or else that the Crimes are not in themselves of so high a nature as Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Example of this, would be an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to all persons that should be hereafter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached by the Commons, to withdraw themselves from Justice; which they would always be ready to do, if not prevented by a Commitment upon their Impeachment: and therefore hope to obtain a more favourable Sentence in a legislative way, than your Lordships would be obliged to pass upon him in your Judicial capacity.</p>
                  <p>The Amendments being all in order to this Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the Commons do not agree to them, for their former Reasons.</p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:46760:69"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ordered,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> do go up to the Lords to desire a Conference with the Lords upon the Amendments by them made to the Bill of Attainder against the Earl of <hi>Danby.</hi>

                     <hi>Resolved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>That the House doth agree to meet the Lords at a present Conference, in the Painted-Chamber.</p>
                  <p>And the Messengers being called in, Mr. Speaker acquaints them that this House did agree to meet the Lords at a present Conference, in the Painted-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ordered,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Members that managed the last Conference, do attend and manage this Conference.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Francis Winnington</hi> reports, that the Members appointed had attended the Conference, and that the Lord <hi>Huntingdon</hi> managed the Conference; and that what he delivered, was to the effect following.</p>
                  <p>THE Lords have desired this Conference with the Commons not so much to argue and dispute, as to mitigate and reconcile.</p>
                  <p>They have already observed, that the debate of this Bill hath given so long and so great an obstruction to publick business; and therefore they desire you to believe that that is the reason which hath chiefly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with their Lordships in a matter of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>And upon this ground it is, that if a way may be found to satisfie and secure the publick fears, by grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing less than the Bill you have proposed.</p>
                  <p>The Lords do not think it advisable to insist upon the utmost and most rigorous satisfaction, to prevent Justice, which might be denied.</p>
                  <p>To induce you to this Compliance, the Lords do acknowledge that Banishment is so far from being the legal Judgment in case of High-Treason, that it is not the legal Judgment in any case whatsoever, since it can never be inflicted but by the Legislative Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46760:73"/> but they see no reason why the Legislative Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority should always be found to act to the utmost extent of its power: for there may be a prudential necessity sometimes of making abatements; and it might be of fatal consequence if it should not be so.</p>
                  <p>And the Lords, to remove all jealousies of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents of this kind, do declare, that nothing which hath been done in the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi>'s Case, shall ever be drawn into example for the time to come, and will so enter it upon their Journal.</p>
                  <p>And thereupon their Lordships insist upon their Amendments so far, as to exclude all Attainders; and do promise themselves the Commons will in this point comply with their Lordships; who do again as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure them that their Resolutions are grounded onely upon their tenderness and consideration of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Resolved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>That the Consideration of the said Report be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed till to morrow-morning ten a clock.</p>

                  <p>That the Committee appointed to inspect and state the Accounts relating to the Army, do make a Report thereof to the House on <hi>Tuesday</hi> next at ten of the clock.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Francis Winnington</hi> acquaints the House, that in pursuance of an Order of the House, he had drawn up into writing the substance of the matter that was delivered at the last free Conference with the Lords; which he read in his place, and afterward delivered the same in at the Clerks Table, where the same was again read, and upon the Question agreed, and is as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>At a free Conference with the Lords relating to the passing the Bill of Attainder against <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> the substance of the matters proposed by the Lords was as followeth.</p>
                  <p>THE Lord Privy-Seal said, that the House of Commons might see by the present quick free Conference with the Lords desired, that their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships did shew their willingness by using all means possible to reconcile both Houses, and to come to such an understanding as to pass the Bill with all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>He declared, that the Reasons of the Commons for passing the Bill as they proposed, were unanswerable; and therefore the Lords were content to make the Bill absolute, without giving the Lord of <hi>Danby</hi> any day to appear, and the penalties to continue.</p>
                  <p>He observed, that the Lord impeached would not onely by the passing of this Bill be ruined, together
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:46760:80"/> with his Family, but likewise those Acquisitions which he got by the Marriage into a noble Family, would be lost.</p>
                  <p>And he intimated, that if the House of Commons would have any other Penalties added to the Bill, their Lordships would leave it to the Commons, so that they run not to the absolute destruction of the Lord impeached. And the Lord Privy-Seal took notice, that although Reason and Justice were of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons side, yet in a Legislative capacity they were to consider Circumstances, in relation to the good of the Publick.</p>
                  <p>Upon this his Lordship said, that in the transaction of this Affair there were two great points gained by this House of Commons: The first was, that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachments made by the Commons in one Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, continue from Session to Session, and from Parliament to Parliament, notwithstanding Proroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Dissolutions. The other point was, that in case of Impeachments upon special matters shewn, if the modesty of the Party Impeached directs him not to withdraw, the Lords admit that of right they ought to order him to withdraw, and that afterwards he must be committed. His Lordship observed, that a Member of the House of Commons mentioned the Earl of <hi>Clarendons</hi> Case at the free Conference in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; but in regard that case was general, and not special matter shown, it was not like this, and therefore he did not understand the Lords intend to extend the points of withdrawing and Commitment to general Impeachments without special matter alleadged; for if it should be otherwise, the Lords did not know how many of their Lordships might be picked out of their House of a sudden.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> said, That they were as willing to be rid of the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. And in the first place, as to the right of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46760:81"/> Commons, that upon Impeachments the Lord accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed ought to withdraw, and then be committed; he said their Lordships did agree it was their right, and well warranted by Presidents of former Ages. And as to the distinction that the Lord Privy-Seal made, where the Impeachments were general, and when spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial matter was alleadged; he said the Lords gave no order to make any such distinction, for that general Impeachments were not in the case: and the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and Lord <hi>Falconberg</hi> affirmed the same, that the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> was in the right, and delivered the true sense of the Lords. He also said, that the expression which they sent with Reasons from the Lords the other day, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Lords would not draw into example the proceedings of the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> but would vacate them; they intended that to extend onely to the points of not withdrawing, and not committing. He likewise declared, that the way now proposed, he thought would be a means to have the Bill pass; for the Commons might have other penalties if they would, as Confiscation of Estate: and though they had no particular order to mention Honours, yet by the general words he thought Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours were included; and if those were insisted on by the Commons, he knew not but they might be agreed to be inserted in the Bill.</p>
                  <p>He desired the Commons would consider that there were weighty Reasons which are better understood than expressed, that prove it necessary for the good of the publick, that this Bill should speedily pass.</p>
                  <p>The Commons replyed, that they hoped their Lordships did not think the Commons did take it as if they had now gained any Point, for that the Points which their Lordships mentioned as gained, were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what was agreeable to the antient course and methods of Parliament.</p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:46760:81"/>
                  <p>The House then took into consideration the first, fourth, sixth, and seventh Amendments made by the Lords to the Bill for the Attainder of <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> of High-Treason; and the said Amendments being read,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Resolved,</hi> &amp;c,</p>
                  <p>That this House doth adhere to the words of the said Bill, mentioned in the first, fourth, sixth, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth amendments made by the Lords to the said Bill.</p>

                  <p>SIR <hi>Henry Ford</hi> reports from the Committee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to examine the matter of the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against Mr. <hi>Castleton,</hi> That the Committee had taken the matter of the said Information into their consideration, and had agreed upon a Report; which he read in his place, and afterwards delivered the same in at the Clerks Table, where the same was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain read, and is as followeth, (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>IN obedience to the Order of this House of the twelfth instant, the Committee have met to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the complaint of Mr. <hi>Chetwind</hi> against Mr. <hi>Castleton,</hi> about defaming by several Aspersions Mr. <hi>Stephen Dugdale</hi> the Kings Evidence; and Mr. <hi>Chet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind</hi> appearing before them, did instance in many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses which had been used by Mr. <hi>Castleton</hi> to that effect; unto which Mr. <hi>Castleton</hi> made answer, That upon the first tidings of Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s evidence given in the Country, there were various reports here spread about to Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s disadvantage in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Money lost by him at Racing, and as if he had behaved himself dishonestly in that matter, as also towards the Lord <hi>Aston:</hi> and he did acknowledge that he made mention to Mr. <hi>Chetwind</hi> of these ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and reflections upon Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> as they were spoken of by other men; but that he was so far from affirming any thing of himself, that he presently writ Letters into <hi>Stafford-shire,</hi> and upon the Answers he had from some Friends there, he did publish, as much as any man, the credit of Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> in all places, and was one of the first that did visit Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:46760:86"/> on his arrival here: and in confirmation herein, Mr. <hi>Chetwind</hi> did own to the Committee, that Mr. <hi>Castleton</hi> did soon after his first discourses, come to him, and declare as to Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s credit, that he was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced; and Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> also being at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, did declare, that he was not sensible that Mr. <hi>Castleton</hi> was his Enemy, or had done him any wrong. So that the Committee finding no other material com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint than this of the Calumny, are humbly of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Mr. <hi>Castleton</hi> may be discharged from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent restraint.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the said Mr. <hi>Castleton</hi> did represent the great misfortune he lay under, in having been seized in custody by the same Warrant wherewith Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> was taken for matters of Treason and high Misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and that the report of it was so far scattered in all places to his disadvantage, that most people have called for their Papers out of his hands, and that he is likely to be ruined in his Livelyhood and way of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, unless the House shall be pleased by some Vote to remove the publick censure which seems to lye upon him by being involved in that Warrant;</p>
                  <p>The Committee have thought fit to enter into some tender consideration of this particular, in regard Mr. <hi>Castleton</hi> appears by very many testimonies to be a good Protestant, and a man of a sober life: but they do submit his desires herein to the pleasure and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the House.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ordered,</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Ordered,</hi>

                  <q>
                     <p>Mr. Speaker,</p>
                     <p>THE Committee which you were pleased to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point to enquire concerning the late Fires that have happened in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> have in obedience to your Order met several times, and have made enquiry, and sent for several persons, and taken Examinations. And as to the late fire in <hi>Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-lane,</hi> they have commanded me to make you this Report.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>And in the first place, Mr. <hi>Robert Bird,</hi> whose house it was that was set on fire, informeth, That his Wife retained one <hi>Elizabeth Oxley</hi> to be her Servant, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her to be a Protestant, upon <hi>Munday</hi> the four and twentieth of <hi>February</hi> last; but she came not to her service until about the 6th of <hi>March.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:46760:106"/>
                  <p>That upon <hi>Wednesday</hi>-night the ninth of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>April,</hi> about two or three of the clock in the morning, his said Servant came to his bed-side and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked him, telling him there was a Fire in <hi>Holbourn;</hi> whereupon he asked her how she knew it? Who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, by the noise in the street; whereupon he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose and looked into the street, but there was but little noise: so he staid at the Street-door till he was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by two men that passed by, that there had been a fire, but it was out again; whereupon he returned to bed well pleased he had so watchful a maid and fearful of fire; but none of his Family knew any thing thereof until informed by the said <hi>Oxley,</hi> as he believeth.</p>
                  <p>That on <hi>Thursday</hi>-night the tenth of this instant <hi>April,</hi> he was told the said <hi>Oxley</hi> went up to bed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten a clock, but he and his Wife went not to bed till eleven or past.</p>
                  <p>That before he went to bed, he diligently looked to the Doors, Windows, and Rooms, that all was safe from Fire and Thieves, as his custom was; and was the last up in the Family, as he thought.</p>
                  <p>That being asleep in bed, he was about twelve a clock that night waked with a great beating at his Street-door by the Watch; and the said <hi>Oxley</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately to him, told him there was a fire; to which he said, he was sure it was not at his house: but gave her the Key of the Street-door, who ran down and let in the Watch and company; and he coming down, found a large Press in his Closet for keeping Books, Papers, and Writings, on a light fire; but by the mercy of God, and the great help he had, the Fire was got out, and his House saved.</p>
                  <p>That his Wife with some Neighbours immediately after going into the said <hi>Oxley</hi>'s Lodging-room to see if all were safe, there found she had packed up
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:46760:107"/> her Clothes and things ready to carry away, and her Trunks were locked up, but nothing left in them of value; whereupon he demanded of the said <hi>Oxley</hi> why she had packed up her Clothes? She answered, that she and his other maid <hi>Martha</hi> had packed up their things to save them. Then he asked the said <hi>Martha</hi> why she had packed up at that time, when the lives of the Children and Family were in such danger? who positively denied that she offered to pack up any thing. Whereupon, and for that he was sure when he went to bed there was not a spark of fire in his Closet where the fire brake forth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that the said <hi>Oxley</hi> came speedily into the Chamber upon the first knocking at the Door, though she lay two pair of stairs above his Chamber; and being informed that she had not put out her Candle into the Candlestick, or burnt it, but pulled it out and hid the Candlestick: and from the manner of her carriage used when she perceived she was suspected, he positively charged the said <hi>Oxley</hi> with firing his House, and caused her to be kept safe all night; and the next day being charged by Neighbours with fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his House, she at last confessed the firing of his House, by fetting the Press in his Closset and his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers on fire about twelve of the clock, when he and his Family was asleep. And he saith, that the said <hi>Oxley</hi> might have gone out of the Back-door of his house, and carried away any of his Goods or Plate if she had pleased at any time of the said night, without firing his house, the Key of the Back-door lying in the Kitchin, and being laid there by her self; and he saith that nothing of value was found in the said <hi>Oxley</hi>'s pack made up by her aforesaid, but her own things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Elizabeth Oxley</hi> upon her Examination declareth, That about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> last she became acquainted
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:46760:107"/> with one <hi>Nicholas Stubbs,</hi> who had several times used much perswasion and arguments to her to turn Papist; and after her shewing a liking to it, and that he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed she had embraced that perswasion, in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to her at several times he told her, that before the eight and twentieth of <hi>June</hi> she should see all the Protestants destroyed that were in <hi>England;</hi> that the Pope should be King over <hi>England,</hi> and that all that would turn to the Popes Religion, should live far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than now they did: That all the Land were He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and that it was a meritorious act to destroy them. That all such as were Papists should have marks upon their Hats to distinguish them from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, that they might not be destroyed with them; adding, that the Nation would believe that all things were over before the eight and twentieth day of <hi>June,</hi> but they would be deceived, for all should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed before, or about that time.</p>
                  <p>That the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was the bravest Prince li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; that he was gone out of this Land because the Hereticks would cut off his Head, and that he would not return till they were destroyed. That the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> would not one of them suffer, for they would come off well enough, being to be tryed by the Lords, and that the Scaffolds were set up but for fashion-sake.</p>
                  <p>That she telling the said <hi>Stubbs</hi> she was hired to live with one Mr. <hi>Bird</hi> about the middle of <hi>Fetter-lane,</hi> he used perswasions to her at several times to set fire on her Masters House, telling her, if she would do it he would give her five Pounds, and gave her half a Crown, and said he would have other Houses fired in <hi>Holborn</hi> at the same time by others.</p>
                  <p>That she being with the said <hi>Stubbs</hi> on <hi>Sunday</hi> before the fire, promised him to fire her Masters House on the <hi>Thursday</hi> or <hi>Friday</hi> following; and accordingly
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46760:108"/> on <hi>Thursday</hi>-night she took a Candle and put fire to the Papers in her Masters Study, which were in a kind of a Press; they being on a light fire, she shut the door, and went up stairs into her own Chamber on the top of the house, and there packed up her own things, and undressing her self lest her Master should suspect her, and there staid till a great knocking was at the door, and the Watchmen crying out fire; whereupon she ran down stairs and cried out fire, and her Master gave her the Key to open the Door; which done, all hands were employed to quench the fire. And she said she did not set fire on her Masters house out of any malice to him, nor with intent to rob him; but merely to carry on the design that <hi>Stubbs</hi> had proposed to her, and out of hopes of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nicholas Stubbs,</hi> upon his Examination, sets forth and owns to have used such discourses to the said <hi>Elizabeth Oxley</hi> as she declares in her Examinations, and saith he did perswade her to fire her Masters house, and was to give her five Guinies for doing it, besides the half-crown in hand. And saith, one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gifford</hi> a Priest, and his Confessor, did put him upon this business, and told him it was no sin to fire all the houses of the Hereticks and Hugonots. That he acquainted one <hi>Flower</hi> alias <hi>Derby, Molrain</hi> an Irish man a Barber in <hi>Jerman-street</hi> with it, and one <hi>Roger Clyton</hi> another Irish-man, who lodges at the Cock and Harp in the same Street.</p>
                  <p>That the said Father <hi>Gifford</hi> promised him an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Pounds for the same, and told him that he was to have the money from the Church.</p>
                  <p>That he used to meet the said Father <hi>Gifford, Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and <hi>Roger Clyton,</hi> in St. <hi>James's Fields,</hi> in the dark in the Evening, and then to discourse of these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and that the several Informations he had given
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46760:108"/> the said <hi>Elizabeth Oxley,</hi> he had from the said Father <hi>Gifford;</hi> and saith, <hi>Flower</hi> and <hi>Roger Clyton</hi> told the said <hi>Stubbs</hi> they would carry on the fire, and that they had Fire-balls to that purpose, and that they would fire all the Houses in <hi>Holbourn</hi> at the same time.</p>
                  <p>That he was at the fire of the <hi>Temple,</hi> but was not engaged to do any thing there; but believes <hi>Flower</hi> was, who he did see there: And saith that <hi>Gifford</hi> told him that there were <hi>English, French,</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Roman-Catholicks enough in <hi>London</hi> to make a very good Army; and that the King of <hi>France</hi> was coming with 60000 men, with a pretence to shew the Dauphin his Dominions, but it was to lay his men at <hi>Diep, Bullen, Calais,</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> to be in readiness at an hours warning to be landed in <hi>England;</hi> and he doubted not but it would be by the middle of <hi>June;</hi> and that by that time all the Catholicks here were to rise, in order to bring him in.</p>
                  <p>That the Papists here were to be distinguished by Marks in their Hats. That the said Father <hi>Gifford</hi> doubted not but he should be an Abbot or a Bishop when the work was over, for the good service he had done. That at their meetings Father <hi>Gifford</hi> used to tell them it was no more sin to kill a Heretick than to kill a Dog; and that they did God good service in doing them what mischief they could, by firing their houses, or otherwise.</p>
                  <p>That it was well Sir <hi>Edmund-bury Godfrey</hi> was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, for he was their devilish Enemy.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Coleman</hi> was a Saint in Heaven for what he hath done.</p>
                  <p>And saith, that he is fearful he shall be murthered for his Confession; Father <hi>Gifford</hi> having sworn him to secrecy, told him he would be damned if he made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny discovery, and should be sure to be killed; and that he should take the Oath, because he was an House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46760:109"/> and it was no sin. And saith, that <hi>Gifford, Flower,</hi> and <hi>Roger Clynton,</hi> told him, when their Forces met about the middle of <hi>June,</hi> then have at the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Resolved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                              <hi>And to shew you, that whilst you are doing your parts, My thoughts have not been Mis-imployed, but that it is my constant care to do every thing that may Preserve your Religion, and secure it for the Future in all Events.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>I have Commanded my Lord Chancellor to mention several Particulars, which I hope will

                                 <hi>THat Royal Care which his Majesty hath taken for the general quiet; and satisfaction of all his Subjects, is now more evident, by these new and fresh Instances of it which I have in Command to open to you.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>His Majesty hath Considered with himself, that tis not enough that your Religion and Liberty is secure during his own Reign, but he thinks he owes it to his People to do all that in Him lies, that these Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings may be transmitted to your Posterity, and so well secured to them, that no Succession in After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages may be able to work the least Alteration.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>And therefore His Majesty, who hath often said in His place, that He is ready to consent to any Laws of this Kind, so that the same extend not to alter the Descent of the Crown in the Right-Line, nor to defeat the Succession, hath now Commanded this to be further Explained.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>And to the end it may never be in the power of any Papist, if the Crown descend upon him, to make any Change either in Church or State; I am Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to tell you, That his Majesty is willing, that Provision may be made first, to distinguish a Papist, from a Protestant Successor; then so to limit, and circumscribe the Authority of a Popish Successor in these cases following, that he may be disabled to do any harm:</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>First, In reference to the Church, His Majesty is content, that care be taken, that all Ecclesiastical and Spiritual Benefices and Promotions in Guifts of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46760:117"/> the Crown, may be conferred in such a manner, that we may be sure the Incumbents shall alwayes be of the most Pious and Learned Protestants: And that no Popish Successor (while he continues so) may have any power to Controul such Presentments.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>In reference to the State, and Civil part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as it is already provided, that no Papist can Sit in either House of Parliament; So the King is pleased, that it be provided too, That there may never want a Parliament when the King shall happen to Dye: But that the Parliament then in Being, may continue Indissolvable for a competent time; Or, if there be no Parliament in being, then the last Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which was in being before that time, may Resemble, and Sit a competent time, without any New Summons, or Elections.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>And as no Papist can by Law hold any place of Trust, so the King is content, that it may be further Provided, That no Lords, or other of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, no Judges of the Common Law, or in Chancery, shall at any time during the Reign of any Popish Successor, be put in, or displaced, but by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Parliament.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>And that care also be taken, that none but sincere Protestants may be Justices of the Peace.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>In Reference to the Military part, the King is willing, That no Lord Lieutenant, or Deputy Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, nor no Officer in the Navy (during the Reign of any Popish Successor) be put out or removed, but either by Authority of Parliament, or of such persons as the Parliament shall intrust with such Authority.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>'<hi>Tis hard to invent an other Restraint to be put upon a Popish Successor, considering how much the Revenue of the Successor will depend upon consent of Parliament, and how impossible it is to raise Money without such Consent. But yet, if any thing else can
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46760:118"/> occur to the Wisdom of the Parliament, which may further secure Religion and Liberty against a Popish Successor, without defeating the Right of Succession it self, His Majesty will most readily Consent to it.</hi>

               <p>1. The Committee, upon perusal of the Act of Parliament made 30. <hi>Caer. 2 Regis,</hi> Entituled, <hi>An Act for granting a Supply to His Majesty of</hi> 619388. l. 11s. 9. d. <hi>for Disbanding the Army, and other Ʋses therein mentioned,</hi> do find the following Clauses, <hi>viz.</hi> pag. 14. <hi>in haec verba. And it is hereby further En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by the Authority aforesaid, That after Orders shall be Registred for the Re-payments of the Loans on this Act, not exceeding</hi> 150000. l. <hi>with Interest as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, and the Forces actually Disbanded, that other Orders of the Lord Treasurer, to the Pay-master of the Land Forces for payment for Clothes and other Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries for the Forces to be Disbanded by this Act, shall he Registred in Course, according to their respective Dates; and that all Orders for Repayment of Moneys Lent, shall be Registred in course, according to the Date
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46760:124"/> of the Tally respectively; and that all other Orders after the actual Disbanding of the Forces, shall be entred in course according to the respective dates, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Page 15. <hi>These Moneys not to be divertible to any other use, intent or purpose whatsoever.</hi> In this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph there seems to be two distinct Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or different Uses and Consignments of the <hi>Moneys</hi> before mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> 150000 l. for the Actual Disbanding of the <hi>Army;</hi> and 50000, &amp;c. for Payment of <hi>Clothes, &amp;c.</hi> had for the Use of the Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 21. It follows in the said Act, <hi>in haec verba, Be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, that all Moneys herein before named, and mentioned, collected and paid by vertue of this Act (except the allowance therein made to respective Collectors, Clerks, Receivers-General, &amp;c. and that shall be issued out of the Exchequer for the Repayment of Loans made in pursuance of this Act, upon the Credit of the said</hi> 2064621. 17s. 3 d. <hi>into the Exchequer, &amp; Interest for the same, shall be applyed, &amp; appropriated, and are hereby appropriated, for the spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and compleat paying, and Disbanding the Forces, Officers, and Souldiers, Raised since the twenty ninth of</hi> September, 1677. <hi>and to no other Intent, Ʋse, or purpose whatsoever. Farther</hi> page <hi>the 27th. Be it Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the said</hi> Treasurer, <hi>or</hi> paymaster <hi>of the Land-Forces, shall in the first place pay off and discharge the Wages, and pay to the Officers and Souldiers at the respective time of their Disbanding; and shall within twenty days after the disbanding of any Regiment, Troop, or Company, or any number of Horse or Foot, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into the Receipt of his Majesty's Exchequer, a Certificate fairly written in Parchment, of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney he paid, and the number of men, together with the days of their Muster, whereby a due account
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46760:124"/> may appear thereof; and out of the residue of the money, he shall pay and discharge what appears due for Cloathes, and other necessaries and charges, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the said Forces, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Paragraphs, seem to appropriate the whole intire sum to the Disbanding of the Army first, yet with a regard to the payment for Cloaths, and necessaries for the Army also.</p>
               <p>Thus far the Act.</p>
               <p>The Committee then desired the Paymaster of the Land-Forces (Mr. <hi>Kingdom</hi>) to inform them what sums of money he had paid in pursuance of the said Act, and by what Orders for the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding of the Army, and what was Rgistred in the Exchequer upon that account, that so they might be fully informed what was undisposed of, and remaining in the Exchequer of all the moneys gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the said Act.</p>
               <p>The said Paymaster informed the Committee, that he had disbursed the whole 200000 <hi>l.</hi> raised upon the Act, in paying off, and Disbanding the Forces, and produced the Coppies of two Orders, the one bearing Date the <hi>23th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1678, for 110000 l. signed</p>

               <p>The Committee also heard what an Honourable Person, a member of this House, Sir <hi>Robert Howard,</hi> could inform them in this matter, who averred, That he was indeed privy unto, and had entred and registred the former Order for 110000 l. which was allowed to be Disbursed for the payment of the Army according to the Act; and believes, that in pursuance of the said Act 40000 l. more might be paid by the said pay-master, towards the Disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Forces; But affirms, that Forty, or Five and Forty Thousand Pound more is yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed of, and must or ought to remain in the Exchequer, or will be there in few dayes; for that he never had, nor would, enter and register any more Orders for other <hi>Moneys,</hi> till the Army was compleatly and actually Disbanded, for that it could not be Justified by the Act.</p>
               <p>This is the utmost Truth, as to the matter of Fact, the Committee could find out in so short a time; and indeed, whether any of the <hi>Moneys</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned, be regularly paid for Disbanding of the Land-Forces, as the Act limits, appropriates and directs (the Army being still kept on) the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee humbly submits to the Opinion of this House.</p>

                           <hi>WE Your Majesties most Loyal and Dutiful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the Commons in this present Parliament assembled; Finding Your Majesties Kingdoms invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in eminent Dangers, and great Difficulties, by the evil Designes, and pernitious Counsels of some, who have been, and are in high Places of Trust and Authority, about Your Royal Person; who, contrary
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:46760:135"/> to the Duty of their Places, by their arbitrary and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive Counsels, tending to the Subversions of the Rights, Liberties, and Properties of Your Subjects, and the Alteration of the</hi> Protestant Religion <hi>Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish't, have endeavoured to alienate the Hearts of Your Loyal Subjects from Your Majesty, and Your Government. Amongst whom, we have just Reason to accuse</hi> John, <hi>Duke of</hi> Lauderdale, <hi>for a chief Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter of such Counsels; and more particularly, for contriving and endeavouring to raise Jealousies and Misunderstandings between Your Majesties Kingdoms of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland; <hi>whereby Hostilities might have ensued, and may arise between both Nations, if not prevented. Wherefore WE, Your Majesties Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Subjects, could not but be sensibly affected with trouble, to find such a Person (notwithstanding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Addresses of the Last</hi> Parliament) <hi>continued in Your Counsels at this time, when the Affairs of Your Kingdom require none to be put into such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, but such as are of known Abilities, Interest, and Esteem in the Nation; without all Suspition of either mistaking, or betraying the true Interest of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and consequently, of advising Your Majesty ill. WE do therefore most humbly beseech Your most Sacred Majesty, for the taking away the great Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies, Dissatisfactions, and Fears amongst Your good Subjects, That Your Majesty will gratiously be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to remove the Duke of</hi> Lauderdale <hi>from Your Majesties Councels, in Your Majesties Kingdoms of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland, <hi>and from all Offices, Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Places of Trust, and from Your Majesty's Presence for ever.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Lords have sent you a Bill, Entituled, <hi>An Act to confirm certain Leases made by</hi> John Drake, <hi>and others; and to enable Sir</hi> Francis Drake, <hi>to make a Joynture, and raise Portions for his Daughters, and Younger Children;</hi> To which they desire the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of this House.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>William Franklin</hi> reports, That the Lords have agreed to sit this Afternoon.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>John Trevor</hi> reports from the Committee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to draw up Reasons, why this House can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree with several of the Amendments made by the Lords, to the Bill, <hi>For Disbanding the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and the Reasons agreed upon by the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee; which he read in his place, and afterwards delivered the same in at the Clerk's Table; where the same were read, and upon the Question a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Commons conceive the Clauses to be unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, because the Bill hath a Relative Clause to the Act</hi> For the Building of the Ships; <hi>wherein the Clause desired by their Lordships, is Enacted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That their Lordships Amendment, touching</hi> Guern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey <hi>and</hi> Jersey, <hi>is such a Disposition of Money, as the Commons have great Reason to be tender of, for Experience. It alters the Bill in several parts, and would be of dangerous Consequence, if admitted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Fifty Thousand Pounds, mentioned in the last Amendment, is already appointed to the paying off, and disbanding the Army; and so there needs no such Clause: And the altering of such Appropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a subsequent Act, would destroy the Credit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Appropriation, to be hereafter made by Act of Parliament.</hi>

                  <hi>First,</hi> That they did desire to see the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Lord High Steward, and the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to former Lords High Stewards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That they did desire to know, what resolutions had been taken about the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, being present or absent at the Tryals of the Lords Impeacht. To the first proposition, the Lords of the Committee produced Copies of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions to the Lords Steward, for the several Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of the Lord <hi>Morley,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Cornwallis;</hi> but those Tryals were out of Parliament, they produced the Copy of the Commission, for the Tryal of the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> for Murther; which Tryal was before the Peers in Parliament: and so differed from the two former Commissions.</p>
               <p>The Lords did further produce a Copy of the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46760:157"/> Commission, passed under the great Seal for the Tryal of <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> and also a form of the Commission for the Tryals of the other Five Lords Impeacht; and did Communicate to the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, a resolution of the Lords House, <hi>in haec verba.</hi>

               <p>An Abstract of the Complaint against Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Deane</hi> and Partners. That Sir <hi>Anthony Deane, Hugh Salisbury</hi> and <hi>John Moor,</hi> being all then Officers of His Majesties Yard at <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> did in the year 1673. cause the Hunter Sloope to be equipped out of His Majesties Stores there, and by the favor of Mr. <hi>Pepys</hi> Secretary to the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, procured a Commission of Reprizal for one Captain <hi>Moone,</hi> to whom they gave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the said Vessel. And accordingly the said <hi>Moone</hi> did perfect his Indenture with His Majesties Store-keeper of the said Yard, and Signed a Bond of a Thousand pound, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the persons abovenamed to be Owners of the said Vessel, and to be accountable to them for such prizes as he should take. That the said Captain <hi>Moone</hi> Sailed with the said Vessel to <hi>Dover,</hi> and then received a Letter from Sir <hi>Anthony Deane,</hi> directing him to Sail with the said Vessel to <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk</hi> or <hi>Callis,</hi> and get her made Free of one of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:46760:171"/> those places, and there likewise to get a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission from the <hi>French</hi> King against the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and that what Money he should expend in the doing thereof, Sir <hi>Anthony Deane</hi> would repay him.</p>
               <p>That Captain <hi>Moone</hi> being sensible of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice of the said design, refused to take the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the said Vessel any longer, and laid her up at <hi>Dover.</hi> That the said Captain <hi>Moone</hi> short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after being at <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> did see the <hi>Hunter Sleepe</hi> aforesaid, then Commanded by Captain <hi>Thomas Swaine,</hi> bring up there the <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>London</hi> as Prize, having taken and Seized on her at Sea, notwithstanding she was a Free Ship of <hi>England,</hi> and belonged to His Majesties Subjects, of which the said Captain gave a present account to the Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> Owners and Freighters of the said <hi>Catharine,</hi> by the Pacquet Boat of <hi>Callis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That during his being at <hi>Callis,</hi> there came over one <hi>Balthazar</hi> St. <hi>Michael,</hi> in one of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Yachts, one of the Owners of the said Ship <hi>Hunter,</hi> and His Majesties Prick-Master at <hi>Deal,</hi> in order to his taking his Journey to <hi>Paris</hi> with Instructions and Letters, one of which was from the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador, to get the said Ship <hi>Catharine</hi> Condemned as prize, notwithstanding, that he knew that it had been proved before His Majesty and Counsel, that the said Ship belonged to His Majesties Subjects, and that His Majesty had writ to his Ambassador in <hi>France,</hi> to use his Interest and Credit in that Court, to get the said Ship the <hi>Catharine</hi> Discharged, and restored to his Subjects to whom she belonged.</p>
               <p>That the said St. <hi>Michel</hi> prevailed accordingly at the <hi>French</hi> Court, and got the said Ship and Goods Re-seized, which by the Interposition of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46760:171"/> His Majesties Ambassador, had been adjudged by the <hi>French</hi> Admiralty to belong to His Majesties Subjects, and an Order granted for the Discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her accordingly.</p>
               <p>That the said Captain <hi>Moone,</hi> after he had quitted the Command of the said <hi>Hunter</hi> Sloop, heard <hi>Thomas Swaine</hi> then Commander of her say, That he received his Provisions for the Victualling of the said Sloop, from His Majesties Victualler at <hi>Dover.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the said Captain <hi>Moone</hi> being Captain of a small Vessel, and coming in her Laden from <hi>Spain,</hi> being bound for <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> put in at the <hi>Cowes,</hi> where Sir <hi>Anthony Deane</hi> and <hi>John Moor</hi> aforesaid, caused him to be prest to be Pilot of the <hi>Norwich</hi> Frigat, where he continued accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly on Board for the space of Eight days, till by Two Boats he was carried on Shore by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and there by the Soldiers of that Garrison carried to Prison, where the said Sir <hi>Anthony Deane</hi> laid an Action of Two thousand pounds upon him, and within half an hour after his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the said Prison, the Jaylor clapt an Iron Shackle Rivetted in with an elvich Hammer on his Right Leg, which said Irons being very streight, caused his Leg to swell so much, that he grew lame all of his right side, and was forced to go on Crutches for the space of Five Months, and after (having continued Six Months in the said Goal) he was removed thence by a <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> into the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> where he remained for the space of Three years, till Discharged thence by the Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>And it appears plainly, not only by the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on presented to this House, of Mr. <hi>Samuel Lamot, Francis Terrence, Joseph Bateman,</hi> and divers others
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:46760:172"/> Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> and by the state of their case, both which they have acknowledged to be true at the Barr of the House of Commons; but also by their Petitions to His Majesty in Counsel; setting forth that Matter and the several Orders and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, His Majesty out of his great Goodness and Justice to his Subjects, was pleased to grant thereupon from time to time, not only condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Piratical proceedings of the said St. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi> Captain <hi>Swaine,</hi> and Accomplices. For which the said St. <hi>Michael</hi> was Committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> but by his directions to his Ambassador in <hi>France,</hi> to get the said Ship and Goods released and restored to the said Merchants; which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done; which said Piratical proceedings was to the damage of the Owners and Merchants to the value of Five thousand pounds, and might have been the occasion of a War between His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and the States General, it being directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Articles of Peace made between them.</p>
               <p>An Abstract of the Complaint against Mr. <hi>Samuel Pepys</hi> and Sir <hi>Anthony Deane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the said Mr. <hi>Pepys</hi> and Sir <hi>Anthony Deane,</hi> did in Conspiracy together, cause Mapps and Sea Journals to be made, one of them mentioning Captain <hi>Mandeus</hi>'s Voyage to St. <hi>Helena,</hi> some Draughts of His Majesties best built Ships, and some Modells of Ships, and Fourteen sheets of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per closely written, containing an Account in what manner the Navy and Admiralty were governed in <hi>England;</hi> as also of the number of the Kings Ships, their several Ages, and their Condition: As also divers other Treasonable Matters, making first of all, Discovery of the State and condition of His Majesties Navy; how and by what means many of the English Seamen may be drawn in the French

                  <hi>Resolved,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it be an Instruction given by this House, to the Committee appointed to joyn with the Committee of Lords, to propose of the Committee of Lords, whether they be yet impoured to give any Answer to the Propositions already made by the Committee of this House, touching the Lords Spiritual, and the Tryal of the Pardon of the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> and acquaint the Lords, that the Committee cannot give any Answer to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions made by their Lordships Preparatory to the Tryal, until those matters be adjusted.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Sachevorel</hi> Reports from the Committee appointed to draw up Reasons, why this House cannot proceed to the Tryal of the Lords, before Judgment given upon the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi>'s Plea of his Pardon, and the point of the Bishops not Voting in any of the proceedings upon Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Capital Offences, and the methods of proceedings adjusted: That the Committee had agreed upon an Answer, to be returned to the last Message of the House of Peers, touching their appointment of the Tryal of the Five Lords in the Tower to be on Tuesday next, together with Reasons for their insisting upon their former Vote, which he read in his place, and afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd the same in at the Clerks Table, where
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:46760:181"/> the same were again read, and some amendments made at the Table upon the Question were agreed, and are as followeth.</p>
               <p>The Commons have always desired that a good correspondency, may be preserved between the two Houses.</p>
               <p>There is now depending between your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships and the Commons, a matter of the greatest weight, in the transaction of which, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships seem to apprehend some difficulty in the matter proposed by the Commons.</p>
               <p>To clear this, the Commons have desired this conference, and by it they hope to manifest to your Lordships, that the propositions of the House of Commons made by their Committee, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Trial of the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> have been only such as have been well warranted by the Laws of Parliament, and constitution of the Government, and in no sort intrench upon the judicature of the Peers, but are most necessary to be insisted upon, that the ancient rights of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature in Parliament may be maintained.</p>
               <p>The Commons readily acknowledge that the crimes charged upon the Earl of <hi>Powis</hi> Viscount <hi>Stafford,</hi> Lord <hi>Petre,</hi> Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of Wardour, and Lord <hi>Bellasis,</hi> are of deep guilt and call for speedy Justice. But withal they hold any change of Judicature in Parliament, made without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in full Parliament, to be of pernicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence both to His Majesty and his Subjects, and conceive themselves obliged to transmit to their posterity, all the rights which of this I find they have received from their Ancestors, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your Lordships in mind of the progress that hath already been, between the Houses in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the propositions made by the Commons,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46760:182"/> and the reasonableness of the propositions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they doubt not to make it appear, that their aimes hath been no other then to avoid such consequence, and preserve that right, and that there is no delay of Justice on their part, and to that end do offer to your Lordships the ensuing reasons and narrative.</p>
               <p>That the Commons in bringing the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> to Justice, and discovery of that execrable and Trayterous conspiracy, of which the Five Lords now stand impeached, and for which some of their wicked accomplices have already under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, the sentence of the Law as Traytors and Murderers, have labored under great difficulties, it is not unknown to your Lordships, that upon the Impeachment of the House of Commons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> for High Treason, and other High Crimes, Misdemeanors and offences, even to the Common Justice of sequestring him from Parliament, and forthwith committing him to safe custody, was then required by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and denyed by the House of Peers, though he then sate in their House, of which your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships have been so sensible, that at a free confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the Tenth of <hi>April</hi> last your Lordships de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that it was the right of the Commons, and well Warranted by former presidents of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, that upon an Impeachment of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, a Peer so Impeached ought of right to be ordered to withdraw; and then to be committed, and had not that Justice been denyed to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, great part of this Session of Parliament, which hath been spent in framing and adjusting a Bill, for causing the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> to appear and answer, that Justice from which he was fled had been saved and had been imployed for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:46760:182"/> of His Majesties Person, and the securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Nation, and in prosecution of the other Five Lords, neither had he had the opportunity of procuring for himself that Illegal Pardon, which bears Date the first of <hi>March</hi> last past, and which he hath now pleaded in Bar of this Impeachment, nor of wasting of so great a portion of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Kingdom, as he hath done since the Commons exhibited their Articles of Impeachment against him.</p>
               <p>After which time thus lost by reason of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of that Justice, which of right belonged to the Commons upon their Impeachment, the said Bill being ready for the Royal Assent, the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> surrendred himself, and by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships order of the Sixteenth of <hi>April</hi> last was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> after which he pleaded the said pardon, and being prest, did at length declare that he would rely upon and abide by that plea, which pardon pleaded being illegal and void, and so ought not to bar or preclude the Commons from having Justice upon the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment.</p>
               <p>They did thereupon, with their Speaker, on the Fifth of <hi>May</hi> instant, in the Names of themselves and of all the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> demand Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against the said Earl, upon their Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not doubting but that your Lordships in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, in all your proceedings upon the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to follow the usual course and methods of Parliament.</p>
               <p>But the Commons were not a little surprized by the Messuage from your Lordships, delivered on the Seventh of <hi>May;</hi> thereby acquainting them, that as well the Lords Spiritual as Temporall, had ordered, that the Tenth of <hi>May</hi> instant, should
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:46760:183"/> be the day for hearing the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> to make good his Plea of Pardon; and that on the Thirteenth of <hi>May</hi> the other Five Lords Impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, should be brought to their Tryal: And that your Lordships had Addressed to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty for Naming a Lord High Steward, as well in the Case of the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> as of the other Five Lords; upon consideration of the said Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suage, the Commons found that the admitting the Lords Spiritual to exercise Jurisdiction in these Causes, was an alteration of the Judicature in Parliament; and which extended as well to the proceedings against the five Lords, as against the Earl of <hi>Danby;</hi> and that if a Lord High Steward be necessary upon Tryals on Impeachments of the Commons; the Power of Judicature in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament upon Impeachments might be defeated, by suspending or denying a Commission to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute a Lord High Steward.</p>
               <p>And that the said days of Trial appointed by your Lordships, were so near to the time of your said message, that the matters and the methods of proceedings upon the Trials, could not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justed by conferences between the two Houses, before the days nominated; and consequently the Commons could not then proceed to the Trial, unless the zeal which they had for speedy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> that so they might proceed to the Trial of the other Five Lords, should induce them at this Juncture, both to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of the enlargement of your Lordships Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and sit down under those and many other hardships (though with the hazard of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons power of Impeachment for time to come) rather than the Trial of the said Five Lords, should be deferred for some short time, whilst these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:46760:183"/> might be agreed on and setled, for reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling differences in these great and weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and for leaving that time which would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily have been spent at debates, and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences betwixt the two Houses, and for expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Trial without giving up the power of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachments, or rendring them ineffectual.</p>
               <p>The Commons thought fit to propose to your Lordships. that a Committee of both Houses might be appointed for this purpose, at which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee (when agreed to by your Lordships) it was first proposed that the time of Trial of the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> should be put off till the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters were adjusted, and it was then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that the propositions as to the time of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, should be the last thing considered, and that the effect of this agreement stands reported up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Lordships Books.</p>
               <p>After which the Commons communicated to your Lordships Committee, a vote of theirs (<hi>viz</hi>) that the Committee of the Commons should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon the former Vote of their House, and that the Lords Spiritual, ought not to have any Vote in any proceedings against the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and that when that matter should be setled. and the methods of Proceedings adjusted, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons would be then ready to proceed upon the Trial of the Pardon of the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> against whom they had before demanded Judgment, and afterwards to the other Five Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> which Vote extended as well to the Earl of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> as the other Five Lords. But the Commons as yet received nothing from your Lordships to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an Answer of that Vote, save that your Lordships have acquainted them, that the Bishops have asked leave of the House of Peers, that they
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:46760:184"/> might withdraw themselves from the Trial of the said Five Lords, with liberty of entring their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual protestations. And though the Commons Committee, have almost dayly declared to your Lordships Committee, that that was a necessary point of right to be setled before the Trials, and offered to debate the same, your Committee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways answered, that they had not any Power from your Lordships, either to confer upon or to give any answer concerning that matter, and yet your Lordships without giving the Commons any satisfactory answer to the said Vote, or permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any conference or debate thereupon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the said agreement, did on <hi>Thursday</hi> the Fourteenth of <hi>May</hi> send a Message to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, declaring that the Lords Spiritual as well as Temporal, had ordered that the Seven and Twentieth of this Instant <hi>May,</hi> be appointed for the Trial of the Five Lords, so that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons cannot but apprehend, that your Lordships have not only departed from what was agreed on, and in effect laid aside that Committee, which was constituted for preserving a good understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt the two Houses, and better dispatch of the weighty Affairs now depending in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but must needs conclude from the said Message and Vote of your Lordships, on the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>May,</hi> that the Lords Spiritual have a right, and sit till the Court proceeds to the Vote of Guilty or not Guilty, and from the Bishops asking leave as appears by your Lordships Books two days after your said Vote, that they might withdraw themselves from the Trial of the said Lords, with liberty of entring their usual prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations, and by their persisting still to go on, and give their Votes in proceedings upon Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:46760:184"/> that their desire of leave to withdraw at the said Trial, is only an evasive Answer to the before mentioned Vote of the Commons, and chiefly intended as an Argument for a right of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, in proceedings upon Impeachments, and as a reason to Judge of the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi>'s Plea of his pardon, and upon those and other like Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachments, although no such Power was ever claimed by their Predecessors, but is utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the Commons. And the Commons are the rather induced to believe it so intended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the very asking leave to withdraw, seems to imply a right to be there, and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be absent without it, because by this way they would have it in their power whether or no for the future, either in the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi>'s case or any other; they will ever ask leave to be absent; and the Temporal Lords alike Power of denying leave, if that should be admitted once necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>The Commons therefore are obliged not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Trial of any of the Five Lords, the Seven and Twentieth of this Instant <hi>May,</hi> but to adhere to their former Vote, and for their so doing, besides what hath been now and formerly by them said to your Lordships, do offer you these reasons following.</p>
               <p>First, because your Lordships have received the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi>'s Plea of his pardon, with a very long and unusual protestation, wherein he hath aspersed His Majesty by false Suggestions, as if His Majesty had commanded or countenanced the Crimes he stands charged with, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly suppressing and discouraging the discovery of the Plot, and endeavoring to introduce an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and Tyrannical way of Government, which
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:46760:185"/> remains as a scandal upon record against His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, tending to render His Person and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment odious to His People, against which it ought to be the Principal care of both Houses to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate His Majesty, by doing Justice upon the said Earl.</p>
               <p>2ly. The setting up a pardon to be a Bar of an Impeachment, defeats the whole use and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Impeachments, or should this point be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted or stand doubted, it would totally discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the exhibiting any for the future, whereby the chief Institution for the preservation of the Government would be destroyed, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Government it self, and therefore the case of the said Earl (which in consequence concerns all Impeachments) ought to be determined before that of the said Five Lords, which is but their particular case.</p>
               <p>And without resorting to many Authorities of great Antiquity, the Commons desire your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships to take notice (with the same regard they do) of the Declaration, which that Excellent Prince King <hi>Charles</hi> the first of Blessed Memory, made in this behalf in his Answer to the Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Proposition of both Houses of Parliament, wherein stating the several parts of his regulated Monarchy, he says, the King, the House of Lords, and the House of Commons, have each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar priviledges, and amongst those which belongs to the King, he reckons of pardoning after the Enumerating of which and other his Prerogatives, His said Majesty adds this again, that a Prince may not make use of his High and Perpetual Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to the hurt of those for whose good he hath it, and make use of the Name of publick necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:46760:185"/> for the gain of his private Favorites and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, to the detriment of his People.</p>
               <p>The House of Commons (an excellent conserve of liberties) is solely intrusted with the first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions concerning Levies of Monies, and the Impeaching of those, who for their own ends (though countenanced by any, surreptitiously got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten command of the King) have violated that Law which he is bound (when he knows it) to protect and to the protection of which they were bound to advise him, at least not to serve him in the contrary.</p>
               <p>And the Lords being intrusted with the Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Power, are an excellent Screen and Banck between the Prince and the People, to assist each against any Eneroachments of the other, and by just Judgment to preserve that Law, which ought to be the rule of every one of the Three. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Power legally placed in both Houses, is more then sufficient to prevent and restrain the Power of Tyranny.</p>
               <p>3ly. Until the Commons of <hi>England</hi> have right done them against this Plea of pardon, they may justly apprehend that the whole Justice of the Kingdom in the case of the Five Lords, may be obstructed and defeated by Pardons of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>4ly. An Impeachment is virtually the voice of every particular Subject of this Kingdom, crying out against an oppression, by which every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that Body equally wounded, and it would prove a matter of ill consequence, that the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality of the People, should have occasion min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred and continued to them, to be apprehensive of utmost dangers from the Crown, whereby they of right expect preservation.</p>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:46760:186"/>
               <p>5ly. The Commons exhibited Articles of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment, against the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the other Five Lords, and demanded Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon those Articles, whereupon your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships having appointed the Trial of the said Earl, to be before that of the other Lords. Now your Lordships having since inverted that order, gives a great cause of doubt to the House of Commons, and raises a Jelousie in the Hearts of all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>England,</hi> that if they should proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Trial of the said Five Lords. In the first place, not only Justice would be obstructed in the case of those Lords, but that they shall never have right done them in the matter of the Plea of Pardon, which is of so fatal consequence to the whole Kingdom, and a new device to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate publick Justice in Parliament.</p>
               <p>Which Reasons and Matters being duly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by your Lordships, the Commons doubt not but your Lordships will receive satisfaction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their propositions and proceedings, and will agree that the Commons, ought not nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without deserting their trust, depart from their former Vote, communicated to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships.</p>
               <p>That the Lords Spiritual ought not to have any Vote in any proceedings against the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and when that matter shall be setled, and the methods of proceedings adjusted, the Commons shall then be ready to proceed upon the Trial of the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> against whom they have already demanded Judgment, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the Trial of the other Five Lords in the <hi>Tower.</hi>
